# Domino and Trax

This program implements 2 games: a version of Domino with square tiles, where you have to match the four sides to place a tile on the board; and Trax, a tile-based game where you have to create a path in your color (rules: http://www.traxgame.com/about_rules.php).

- compile with "make"
- run with "./go"

The games are played in the terminal.
